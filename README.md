# 👨‍💻 Hi, I'm Chukwubuikem Wisdom — Software Developer & IT Specialist 🚀
---

I started out fixing systems, providing **IT Support**, **Networking**, and **System Troubleshooting** across various operating systems — helping individuals and businesses solve real-world tech challenges.

Today, I design and build **modern full-stack applications**, crafting **robust**, **efficient**, and **user-friendly** web and mobile experiences.

I'm passionate about **building tech that elevates people** and contributing to a growing developer community. I enjoy working with **React.js**, **Node.js**, **REST APIs**, and **GraphQL**.  
I'm always looking for ways to **learn**, **contribute**, and **help others grow** in the tech world — whether through projects, collaboration, or community efforts.
